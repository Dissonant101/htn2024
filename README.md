## Inspiration

According to StatCan, over 200 Canadian lives are claimed by fire-related incidents each year. In these dire emergencies, [minutes and seconds matter](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/o1/en/plus/1968-key-numbers-unintentional-fire-related-deaths-and-how-most-are-preventable). This is why we created **Firescape**, an app that charts indoor floor plans, predicts fire locations, and steers civilians to safety.

## Features
- Precise and accurate indoor maps of buildings of any type.
- Custom algorithm calculating the shortest path to a fire exit.
- Real-time location updates of those in the same building.
- Smart formula to predict the location and intensity of fires based on location data.

## Technologies
We used Mappedin to create maps of buildings using floor plans. User location data is stored in Convex databases. The front-end is created in Next.js and deployed using Vercel.

## Challenges
- We originally had our sights set on a hardware-based project; unfortunately, due to the limited quantity of microcontrollers, we were unable to continue our project. This cut our working time in half but we adapted to our circumstances and created an app that we are proud of.
- Despite our 180-degree shift into a software-based project along with very unfamiliar and new technologies, our team had to quickly learn and adjust in order to compete with other contestants.

## Accomplishments
- We are proud of finishing our product. We believe that our application would be effective in emergency situations and improve general fire safety.
- Collaborating with teammates to learn a new tech stack in less than 18 hours is nothing less than impressive for all of us

## What we learned
- New frameworks and libraries 
- Coming up with ideas is really hard

## Roadmap

Due to Mappedin's incredible AI capabilities of turning any floor plan into a 3D map, we believe that Firescape can be quickly adapted to any building, especially those of high risks of fire-related accidents, such as hotels.
